## About 

_xPlain_ is a software package for _Wolfram_ (formerly _Mathematica_) designed to format mathematical derivations in theoretical physics. It bridges the gap between programmatic computation and professional presentation by enabling both command-line and notebook interfaces while maintaining consistent, paper-quality mathematical typesetting.

The package addresses a fundamental challenge in theoretical physics: how to simultaneously:
- Retain the notebook front-end's mathematical formatting capabilities
- Present calculations with paper-style layout
- Work entirely in plaintext using professional development tools

_xPlain_ is an (unofficial) part of the [xAct bundle](http://www.xact.es/) and implements the [FAIR guiding principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) for scientific data management. It is designed for unambiguous, lasting derivations in the Wolfram Language and is suitable for researchers who use the Wolfram Language programmatically.

The package has been successfully used in [published supplemental materials](https://github.com/wevbarker/SupplementalMaterials-2306), receiving positive feedback from anonymous referees: "_It is remarkable the effort made by the authors with the Supplemental Material to show the connection between the Mathematica code employed for the computations and the statements in the paper._"

## Example: Basic Mathematical Document 

As a demonstration, we consider formatting a simple mathematical derivation with sectioning, commentary, and cross-references.

In a fresh notebook we first load the package:
```mathematica
<<xAct`xPlain`;
```
Next, we create document structure using sectioning commands:
```mathematica
Title@"Welcome to the xPlain package, here is a title";
Chapter@"And here is a chapter";
Section@"And here is a section";
Subsection@"And here is a subsection";
```
We add commentary and define formatted variables:
```mathematica
Comment@"This is a comment. We will next type a numbered expression.";
Format@xx^=ToExpression@"\[ScriptX]";
DisplayExpression[xx,EqnLabel->"Eq1"];
```
For expressions that vanish, use the equation environment:
```mathematica
Comment@"And next we will type a numbered equation.";
DisplayEquation[xx,EqnLabel->"Eq2"];
```
Cross-references are handled automatically:
```mathematica
Comment@{"Here is a comment referring to",Cref@"Eq1",". We can also refer to multiple equations as",Cref@{"Eq1","Eq2"},"."};
Supercomment@{"Here is a comment referring to",Cref@"Eq1"," and multiple equations as",Cref@{"Eq1","Eq2"},"."};
```
The output is shown below:

## Documentation

The package includes a comprehensive example notebook demonstrating all basic functionality. To run the examples:
```console
[user@system xPlain]$ cp xAct/xPlain/Documentation/English/Examples.nb ~/Examples.nb
[user@system xPlain]$ cd ~
[user@system ~]$ wolframnb Examples.nb &
```

## General use

### Document Structure

The package provides hierarchical sectioning commands:
- `Title["title text"]` - Document title
- `Chapter["chapter text"]` - Chapter heading 
- `Section["section text"]` - Section heading
- `Subsection["subsection text"]` - Subsection heading

### Commentary and Display

- `Comment["text"]` or `Comment[{"text", Cref["label"], "more text"}]` - Regular commentary with optional cross-references
- `Supercomment[...]` - Emphasized commentary
- `DisplayExpression[expr, EqnLabel->"label"]` - Numbered mathematical expression
- `DisplayEquation[expr, EqnLabel->"label"]` - Numbered equation (implies vanishing)

### Cross-referencing

- `Cref["label"]` - Reference to a single equation
- `Cref[{"label1", "label2"}]` - Reference to multiple equations
- `Mref["label"]` - Alternative reference format

### Mathematical Formatting

Format variables using standard Wolfram Language conventions:
```mathematica
Format@myvar^=ToExpression@"\[ScriptM]";
```
